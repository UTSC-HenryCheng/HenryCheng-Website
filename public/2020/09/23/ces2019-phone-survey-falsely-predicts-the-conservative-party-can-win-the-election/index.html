<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>The Liberal Party won the 2019 federal election. In the study, we explore the ces2019 phone survey data set. We found out that the survey result actually favor on the Conservative Party</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>We use <span class="citation">Wickham et al. (2019)</span>, <span class="citation">R Core Team (2020)</span>, <span class="citation">Allaire et al. (2020)</span>, <span class="citation">Wickham, Hester, and Chang (2020)</span>, <span class="citation">Hodgetts and Alexander (2020)</span>, <span class="citation">Xie (2020)</span></p>
<p>The Canadian Liberal Party won the 2019 Federal Election by getting 46.4% seats and 33.1% votes (Elections Canada, 2019).In this study, we are interested at finding the supporting rate of Liberal Party in the ces2019_phone survey. We look at how well the ces2019_phone survey can predict the Federal Election. More importantly, we want to see did this survey obtain a sufficient sample to represent the entire voter population.</p>
<p>In this study, we construct tables and graphs to see which party the survey participants are likely to vote for. Surprisingly, we found out that more participants are willing to vote for the Conservative Party rather than the Liberal Party. There are only about 22.6% of the survey participants are likely to vote for Liberal Party. By comparing with the federal election result, which is the Liberal Party won 33.1% of the votes. We can see that the result is not very accurate. The collected sample of this survey is not sufficient enough to represent the entire voters’ actions.</p>
<p>In the following, we provide some of the data from the survey. By manipulating the data set, we construct several tables and graphs along with 4 findings. Later we look at some of the weaknesses and the further work we can work on.</p>

<p>The variables we focus on are q3(Gender) and q11(Which party will you likely to vote for). For q3, male denoted by 1; female denoted by 2 and others denoted by 3. For q11, -9 is “Don’t know”; -8 is “Refused”; 1 is “Liberal”; 2 is “conservatives; 3 is”NDP“; 4 is”Quebecois“; 5 is”Green“; 6 is”People“; 7 is”Other“; 9 is”None“; 10 is” Will spoil ballet</p>

<div id="finding-1" class="section level1">
<h1>Finding #1</h1>
<p>First, we split the data set by genders. We found out that only 1 participant choose others, the rest of the participants are distributed by male and female. From Figure 1., we see that the amount of male participants is a little bit more than the amount of female participants in this phone survey. There are about 56.5% of the survey participants are male and 43.5% of the survey participants are female.So it is reasonable to split the data set into male and female and study them separately. Later in the study, we will focus on male participants and female participants.</p>

<p>In this case, we look at male participants. From the Figure 2., the popular choice is actually 2(Conservative). We notice that there is only about 21.7% of male participants chose Liberal be the party they are likely to vote for, which is much less than the actual federal election result(33.1%).</p>

<p>Last but not least, we look at all the participants. From the Figure 4., we see that choice 2(Conservative) is a little more than choice 1(Liberal) due to larger amount of male participants.

<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>The result of this survey shows Conservative Party is more popular than Liberal Party. There are only about 22.6% of the participants are willing to vote Liberal Party. By comparing with the federal election result(Liberal won the election with 33.1% of the votes), we can conclude that this survey result is not accurate. Indeed, the collected sample data is not representative for the voting population. Since this is a phone survey, there are large amount of people that don’t have cell phone or not familiar with phone survey became non-respondents. This non-response caused the result to be biased, and skewed to the preference of phone users. Also, from the graphs in finding #2,3,4, we notice that there are huge amount of participants chose -9(Don’t know). However, they are potential voters that would vote in the federal election. These people create great uncertainty in this study. They are largely influence the result by skewing the data to -9(Don’t know). Which can be a explanation that why the Liberal Party supporting rate is low.</p>
<div id="weaknesses-and-next-steps" class="section level2">
<h2>Weaknesses and Next Steps</h2>
<p>The weaknesses of this study is that this is only the ces2019 phone survey. There is also a ces2019 web survey. By only analyzing the data set from ces2019 phone survey is not sufficient enough to criticize this survey and test the reliability. In the future, we can combine the result from ces2019 phone survey and ces2019 web survey to create a more comprehensive data set. Also, we cam filter the choice -9(Don’t know) to avoid the skewness of the data set.</p>
